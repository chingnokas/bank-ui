#12 13.14 "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
#12 13.14 declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
#12 13.14 "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
#12 13.14 node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it [1mmay break at any time[0;33m.

#12 13.14 babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, [1mwhich

#12 13.14 ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
#12 13.14 your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
